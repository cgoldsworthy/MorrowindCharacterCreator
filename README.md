Morrowind character creation forum I made for my Web Systems final project

Ran using XAMPP. This is a character creation forum I made for my Web Systems final project. If you want to run it, go into db_connection.php
and modify the dbname attribute (there are comments in that file showing the spot where you need to change it). After creating the database
run the sql file to create the tables.
